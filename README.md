# The Eazy Hax RetroPie Toolkit
I have spent an insane amount of time developing and maintaining this kit over the past two years for you guys and its been a blast! Due to changes that the team at RetroPie and Raspberry Pi have made to the OS the scripts require regular maintenance to function reliably....so update your scripts often or make sure you subscribe to my channel and enable notifications so you don't miss out! 
 

## Install the toolkit to run through the RetroPie Menu on the pi itself
### Enable SSH (Required for Windows or Mac users)

First your RetroPie must be connected to the internet through your home network so you can
A. Connect to your Pi 
B. Download the toolkit and config file

Now on with enabling ssh.....

1. Go to the RetroPie Menu and select Raspi-config

1. If this is your first time launching one of the scripts in the toolkit then windows will give you a warning. (Dont worry...I wrote all these myself and they are harmless) Click "More Info"

1. A screen will pop up with text showing you the status of the install and informing you that your pi will be rebooted so the scripts show up.
